## Introduction
Welcome to r/BrewCrew, a static subreddit clone developed using JavaScript/HTML/CSS. 
A user can save, upvote, downvote posts and even submit their own posts.
This is my first developed project, meant to showcase my growing skills in front end development.

## Features
- Backend Integration: Utilizes HTTP requests to interact with a backend server, enabling functionalities like fetching, creating, updating, and deleting beer data.

- Dynamic Rendering: Dynamically generates HTML elements based on fetched beer data, facilitating the rendering of individual beer posts with various attributes like author, title, description, and image.

- User Interactivity: Enhances user experience by implementing event listeners for interactive elements such as upvote/downvote buttons, saving buttons, and form submission, enabling users to perform actions like voting, saving, and commenting.

- Form Handling: Manages form submission to add new beer posts, validating input fields and sending POST requests to the server to store the new beer data, ensuring seamless integration of user-generated content.

- Data Patching: Implements PATCH requests to update specific attributes of existing beer posts, such as likes count and saved status, allowing users to interact with and modify beer data dynamically without reloading the page.
